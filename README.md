# ProgJobSearch
An automated system to help programmers find orders on freelance burses

# For whom?
For Python programmers who want to simplify and automate the order search procedure

# How will this help?
The system reads and outputs texts from four freelance burses to the terminal at once, which allows you not to view everything in the browser yourself, but simply press a few buttons.

# How to download and use it?
The system is available on Linux, Termux and any Python interpreters. Before installing, make sure you have a new Python interpreter and pip package manager.

Download on Linux:
1. apt update
2. apt upgrade -y
3. git clone https://github.com/PyCodeMan/ProgJobSearch/
4. pip install -r requirements

Download on Termux:
1. pkg update
2. pkg upgrade -y
3. git clone https://github.com/PyCodeMan/ProgJobSearch/
4. pip install -r requirements

# How to use on Windows or Android?
If you have a Python interpreter on Android or Windows, just copy and paste the program code there. However, do not forget about installing the libraries necessary for the program to work - bs4, time and requests.

When you are done with the installation, just start the system using the command `python ProgJobSearch` (if it didn't work, `python 3 ProgJobSearch`) and select the necessary parameters. The menu is intuitive and not difficult to interact.
